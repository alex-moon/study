Missing Java, realise I don't really know J2SE as well as I should.

Long story short, plan is:

1. Download everything from Quandl [https://docs.quandl.com/]
2. Correlate it all together

Pretty simple problem I guess. Plan is to do it all with only Core Java libraries why not.

Ultimately what'd be great is then to build a simple J2EE app that'll draw the graphs and so on.

Documentation
=============

1. Start a new Maven project in Eclipse with archetype "j2ee simple"
